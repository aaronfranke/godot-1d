		A 1D sprite node that displays an image in 1D, one row of pixels at a time. Each row is a frame.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A node that displays a 1D texture. An un-animated 1D texture is an image with a height of 1 pixel.
		If the texture has multiple rows of pixels (height greater than 1px), only one row of pixels will be displayed at a time. Each is a 1D frame and the frame can be changed by adjusting [member frame].

	<methods>
		<method name="get_frame_count" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the amount of frames available to this [Sprite1D]. This is the same the height of the image. Each row of pixels is a 1D frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rect" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Rect2" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Rect2] representing the [Sprite1D]'s boundary in local coordinates. Can be used to detect if the [Sprite1D] was clicked. This behaves identically to [Sprite2D]'s method.
