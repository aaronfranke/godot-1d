		1D collision object base class (abstract, can't be instanced).
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		1D collision object. This node is the base type for other physics nodes such as [Area1D] and [StaticBody1D] and can't be instanced directly.
		Unlike 2D and 3D, there is no point to collision [b]shapes[/b]. In 1D, the only available geometric shape is a line segment. It only has a size. We interpret the node's position as the center of this shape.
