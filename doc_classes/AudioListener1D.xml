		Overrides the location sounds are heard from in 1D.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Once added to the scene tree, this node will override the location sounds are heard from.
		Only one [AudioListener1D] can be current. Setting [member current] to [code]true[/code] will disable the previous [AudioListener1D] (and disable any [AudioListener2D] nodes).
		This node will attempt to automatically set itself as current, but if there are multiple you will need to explicitly set one as current.
		If there is no active [AudioListener1D] in the current [Viewport], the center of the screen will be used as a hearing point for the audio. [AudioListener1D] needs to be inside the [SceneTree] to function.
